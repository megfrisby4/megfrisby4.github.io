#character class  -- things in quotes
letters
class(letters)  #character vector, what type of class is it?
length(letters) #the length of the vector --- number of elements in a vector
rep(letters,2) # repeat the vector n (n=2) times 
rep(letters,each=2)
length(rep(letters,2)) #=52 what is the length of letters repeated twice
class(length(rep(letters,2))) # integer vector, in parenthesis is 52 so its giving class of 52
length(class(length(rep(letters,2)))) # output is integer, only 1 character 
rep() #repeat
# rep(vector, each=n) --- repeat each charactere n times 
rep(letters, each=2) #repeat each letter twice 
rep(letters, each=2)[20] # brackets choose which specific elememt
rep(letters, each=2)[20:25] # : = through, 20 through 25
# [] let you access specific element of any object
# you cant add vectors of different classes

x <- "1" # x = character 1
x+1 #not gonna work
as.numeric(x) #as.numeric changes characters to numeric
as.numeric(x) +1 $#so this will work now
  
as.character(123) #changes number into a character
123+1 #wont work because 123 is now a character

y <- c(1:10,"One") #creating a vector
#vectors can only be one class
#if there is one character in a vector, the whole vector will be characters!
as.numeric(y) #as. function changes vecor classes, it wont know what 
# to do with"one
#NA = missing data
NA
TRUE
FALSE

#factors are for discreet variables -- like eye color have specific levels

as.character(z) #makes factor into character vector
as.numeric(z) # makes factor into numeric vector

# ! = not
1 !=5 #one is not equal to five, that is true
