```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

This is my first report. Or my chemistry lab homework or whatever. 

I can **bold** some text or even make it *italic*

here's a plot of penguins:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex, y=body_mass_g, color=species)) +  geom_boxplot()





```
here is a picture of a hamburger which penguins love to eat:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./hamburger.png")
```
