#identity of each item in the list, then you put 'in' and then whatever vector you want the 'for' command to read from
#inside the weird brackets you put 'print' because you want the command to print the first lines of the files, then
#you put readlines because you want specific lines from each file printed, and then you put your variable 
#which again is taking on the identify of each item in the vector, and then the number of lines from each file 
#you want read.

#same dealio here, I needed to allow full names to get the full file path, create a variable, for each item in my vector
#I want the command to print the first line of every file, so  I put readlines, my variable, and then the number of lines.
